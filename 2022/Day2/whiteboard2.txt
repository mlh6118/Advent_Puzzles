Questions:
1. Will there ever be a round where only one RPS is available?

Input/Output:
Input: Two chars
Output: a number

Big O:
Space:
Time:

Test Cases:

Visualization:
See alternate paper.

Algorithm:
1. Open input file.
2. Create variable total_score.
3. Read line of input and split based on space between chars.
4. Check second char for X, Y, or Z. (R = X, P = Y, S = Z)
5. Add points based on second char. (X = 1, Y = 2, Z = 3)
6. Compare second char to first char to determine win, loss, or draw.
    Draw (3pts) => A = X, B = Y, C = Z
    Loss (0pts) => B > X, C > Y, A > Z
    Win  (6pts) => X > C, Y > A, Z > B
7. Add points to total score based on win, loss, or draw.
8. Return total score.
